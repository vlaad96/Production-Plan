# Introduction

### What is a production plan?

One general [definition](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/production-planning.html) for all industries would be: "It is an administrative process that takes place within a business and involves making sure that there are enough staff, raw materials, and other necessary items in order to create a finished product according to a specified schedule. It's  aim is to maximize profitability."
Now, in the videogames industry, we take this general idea and apply it to our case. Depending on the size of the team, the production plan will be done by the whole team, if it is a small one; or by the leads of each area if it is a large one. 
[Mark Claypool](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/claypool) said on a study that for a professional game, to get the initial idea of a game would take about a month time, and to get the idea conceptualized, would take roughly 3 months.

# What do we need to know before doing a Production Plan?

There are several phases in the development process of a video game and all of them need some planning.

## Phases in the development of the game

### Preparation

During this phase, the team needs to determine the tools needed to set the development environment as well as specify the platform for which the game will be created and the target audience. The milestones of the preparation consist of team selection, target platform, target market and develoment environment.

### Pre-Production

It is the first of the steps and it involves gathering all the information needed to start the game. During that time, the developers need to define the idea and conceptualize it, meaning that all the details of the game should be clear and all the documentation needed to start the developing of the game should be ready. It consists of concept creation, prototyping, and creating the documentation such as the GDD or the TDD and of course the production plan.

### Production

During this time, the team members will work to create a first version or prototype of the game at first, the 'Vertical Slice'. After finishing the initial version of the game, the idea is presented to an investor and if he or she is interested in the idea, the team proceeds with the developing process to create an alpha version of the game. This is the phase where most of the changes will be made, as during the development, many issues will come. It is also the most time and money costing.

### Post-Production

Get the game to a beta version and start testing it with a small audience. Get all the bugs fixed and launch the game into a platform. 

## Budget

It includes all the costs for the development of the project. It can be divided by branches.

**Staff:** This icludes all the salaries for each memeber of the development team as well as of those one in charge of the management and marketing.

**Environment:** Here goes all the expenses such as the rental of the studio, electricity, water, etc.

**Research:** There are always costs that go into the research of information and are needed to take into account when planning the project.

**Licenses:** Probably you will be using some licenses that need to be paid of in order to be used legally.

**Entertainment:** In order for the team to be better, usually the leads organize activities to get the team to know each other better. Those activities can be basic ones such as going to eat together or more expensive such as travelling.

## Deviation

In all projects, even the ones that have been planned very carefully, there are always some deviation during the actual development. This means that even though a shcedule is cretaed, most likely the final result will have been different than what was scheduled.

# Tools

A production plan can be done useing different simple tools. All you really need is a sheet where you can organize your work. Of course there are some tools that make the work easier. The most common way to create a production plan is using Gantt charts. If you do not know what a Gantt chart is or how it works, this is for you.
Well, a Gantt chart is basically an organizational tool that lets you establish all the tasks that are needed to be done during the project, organize them by milestones and have an estimation of the time that it will take for each task to be done.
Here's an example.

# How to create a great Production Plan?

There are several advantages on createing a good production plan. Some of them would be a reduced labour costs by eliminating wasted time and impproving process flow, optimized usage of equipment and staff, imporved on time deliveries and milestones.
The objectives of a great production plan can be broken down by the following:
* Effective resource utilization
* Steady flow or production
* Optimal inventory levels
* Coordination between multiple departments
* Labort productivity improvement
* Reduce production cost
* On time delivery
* High quality products
* High customer satisfaction

### Step by step

**Create an initial planning.** The initial idea and planning will determine the course of the project. If the details and boundries of the project are not set clearly, the project will be hard to develop. Although this step is not unchangeable, it should be as accurate as possible.

**Create a feature list.** It is a task list of all the features that are documented in the GDD and the TDD. They all have to be specified.

**Create a staffing plan.**  It is another list where all the required staff is specified. An important part to take into account is that the main area where the budget goes into are the salaries of the workers, In order to organize the cost and time for worker, a [man-month](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/man-month) * 'One person's working time for a month, or the equivalent, used as a measure of how much work or labor is required or consumed to perform some task.' *

**Assign tasks.** When working in a huge team, the leads of each department will assign the tasks and features that need to be done and also will have to assign each task to a team member. In smaller teams, every member will get a role and will be responsible for it.

**Management between teams.** The management will work with the leads of each role to know the work that needs to be done and will look into the tasks and match dependencies between each team. Organizing the work, prevents creating features that may not be used at that time or may never be used. For example, you cannot create particles for an explosion when you do not even know if there will be grenades in the shooting game.

**Schedule.** It is the most difficult part of the planning as the manager needs to create an estimated start and end date for each of the tasks. The most visual way to organize the information is using a Gantt chart, however, it can be done in an excel document as well or other softwares where you can create charts and tables. Risk and contingency has to be taken into account as well, as some of the tasks will actually take more time than estimated, and there can be internal or external issues that can make the tasks take longer than expected (personal issues, disease, delays on features, etc). This step is really time consuming but it shows an approximation of how long the project will take to be completed.

**Milestones.** Milestones are a sign of an important achievement and have no duration time. The milestones should follow a clear sequence of events that incrementally build up until a project is finished. It is a way to know how is the project advancing. During a game development, there are usually three main milestones: *Vertical slice*, it is a simple prototype to see the key features of the game; *Alpha*, a playable game with all the features implemented but may have bugs and probably will need to be polished in some aspects; *Beta*, a polished version of the Alpha, and with less bugs.

## Risk Management vs Contingency Planning

**Risk Management:** "is the practice of identifying, assessing, avoiding, mitigating, transferring, sharing and accepting risk."
*quoted by web page: https://simplicable.com/new/risk-management-vs-contingency-planning

**Contingency plaaning:** "is the practice of identifying steps to be taken if a risk occurs."
*quoted by web page: https://simplicable.com/new/risk-management-vs-contingency-planning

Though these are similar ideas, there are differences between risk management and contingency planning. While risk management focuses on steps that need to be taken to reduce risk such as risk avoidance ("is the elimination of hazards, activities, and exposures that can negatively affect an organization's assets. Whereas risk management aims to control the damages and financial consequences of threatening events, risk avoidance seeks to avoid compromising events entirely.", *https://www.mha-it.com/2016/11/30/defining-risk-avoidance/*) or mitigation ("the act of reducing how harmful, unpleasant, or bad something is", *https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mitigation*). Risk management also takes into account that there are risks that sometimes are worth taking.
Meanwhile, contingency planning is the planning of the steps or actions that need to be taken when the risk occurs. Contingency planning is usually used when the risk is quite improbably but the impact would cause a huge disruption in the development process.

Parting from these definitions, of risk management and contingency planning, a plan is created to help the teams prevent major problems when problems occur. All projects have risks, smaller or bigger, and every member of the team should know what to do if the risk becomes a reality. That is why a risk and contingency document is created as a part of a paroduction plan.
If there are a lot of risks, is a good idea to organize them by work areas,
