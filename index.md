I am [Vladislav Bulantsev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladislav-bulantsev-357281166/) a student of the [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu), currently doing the Videogames Design and Development degree. This research is done for the second year subject Project II under the supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu/).

# Introduction

### What is a production plan?

One general definition for all industries would be: It is an administrative process that takes place within a business and involves making sure that there are enough staff, raw materials, and other necessary items in order to create a finished product according to a specified schedule. It's  aim is to maximize profitability.
Now, in the videogames industry, we take this general idea and apply it to our case. Depending on the size of the team, the production plan will be done by the whole team, if it is a small one; or by the leads of each area if it is a large one. 
[Mark Claypool](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/claypool) said on a study that for a professional game, to get the initial idea of a game would take about a month time, and to get the idea conceptualized, would take roughly 3 months.

### Why is it important?

The main reason is that ideas change over time. Getting into a game development project without planning, the development often deviates from the original idea. To try to avoid the deviation, a production plan is done.

# What do we need to know before doing a Production Plan)

There are several phases in the development process of a video game and all of them need some planning.

## Phases in the development of the game

### Preparation

During this phase, the team needs to determine the tools needed to set the development environment as well as specify the platform for which the game will be created and the target audience. The milestones of the preparation consist of team selection, target platform, target market and develoment environment.

### Pre-Production

It is the first of the steps and it involves gathering all the information needed to start the game. During that time, the developers need to define the idea and conceptualize it, meaning that all the details of the game should be clear and all the documentation needed to start the developing of the game should be ready. It consists of concept creation, prototyping, and creating the documentation such as the GDD or the TDD and of course the production plan.

### Production

During this time, the team members will work to create a first version or prototype of the game at first, the 'Vertical Slice'. After finishing the initial version of the game, the idea is presented to an investor and if he or she is interested in the idea, the team proceeds with the developing process to create an alpha version of the game. This is the phase where most of the changes will be made, as during the development, many issues will come. It is also the most time and money costing.

### Post-Production

Get the game to a beta version and start testing it with a small audience. Get all the bugs fixed and launch the game into a platform. 

## Budget

It includes all the costs for the development of the project. It can be divided by branches.
### Staff
This icludes all the salaries for each memeber of the development team as well as of those one in charge of the management and marketing.
### Environment
Here goes all the expenses such as the rental of the studio, electricity, water, etc.
### Research
There are always costs that go into the research of information and are needed to take into account when planning the project.
### Licenses
Probably you will be using some licenses that need to be paid of in order to be used legally.
### Entertainment
In order for the team to be better, usually the leads organize activities to get the team to know each other better. Those activities can be basic ones such as going to eat together or more expensive such as travelling.
