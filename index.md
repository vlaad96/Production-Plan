I am [Vladislav Bulantsev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladislav-bulantsev-357281166/) a student of the [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu), currently doing the Videogames Design and Development degree. This research is done for the second year subject Project II under the supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu/).

## Introduction

# What is a production plan?

One general definition for all industries would be: It is an administrative process that takes place within a business and involves making sure that there are enough staff, raw materials, and other necessary items in order to create a finished product according to a specified schedule. It's  aim is to maximize profitability.
Now, in the videogames industry, we take this general idea and apply it to our case. Depending on the size of the team, the production plan will be done by the whole team, if it is a small one; or by the leads of each area if it is a large one. 
[Mark Claypool](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/claypool) said on a study that for a professional game, to get the initial idea of a game would take about a month time, and to get the idea conceptualized, would take roughly 3 months.

# Why is it important?

The main reason is that ideas change over time. Getting into a game development project without planning, the development often deviates from the original idea. To try to avoid the deviation, a production plan is done.
